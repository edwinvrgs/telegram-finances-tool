## Telegram Finances Tool

This is a simple parser to telegram messages of the form: <strong>AMOUNT CURRENCY - DESCRIPTION</strong>. And outputs a .csv file with columns for the amouny, currency, date, description and category.

Note: this is a very simple tool, and made for my needs, the final file might need your hand.


... Because is very useful for me I hope be improving it very soon.
